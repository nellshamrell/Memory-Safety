# OpenSSF Memory Safety Project Support Program

NOTE - This is currently a draft and this program has not been launched yet!

The following document describes the different models in which the OpenSSF Memory Safety SIG can support your project, and the key factors we consider when evaluating projects, with a special focus on whether your project is technically doable. It aims to help you understand what we're looking for to make sure your project can help increase memory safety at scale.

## Support Models

The SIG supports the following modes of support

* **Request funding** - projects may seek financial funding (hard-cost), where dedicated resources can make a difference in their development and sustainability. These projects often include software solutions addressing critical challenges in the open source ecosystem

* **Request resource support** - projects that request resource (soft-cost) support, such as access to technical expertise or collaboration opportunities. These encompass a wide spectrum, from educational platforms to initiatives promoting open-source adoption of memory safeness.

A project can submit its support request through the SIG repository issues (TODO: add issue template) and project members are welcome to join the SIG bi-weekly calls to present their work and support request.

## Criteria for Support

**Aims to improve the state of memory safety in OSS:** The Open SSF memory safety SIG [objective](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety#objective) is to "Eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities in Open Source Software". We would be happy to support projects that are in [scope](https://github.com/ossf/Memory-Safety#scope) and align with our mission. [checked at both support models]

**Active Development:** Is the project actively maintained and developed. We look at the frequency of commits and releases. [checked at both support models]

**Community Engagement and support:** Is the project showing healthy signs of community engagement and/or support and usage. We check the project's discussions and issues comments to see collaboration among users and developers, preferable from more than one organization. [checked at the request for funding support mode]

**Documentation:** Is the project well documented and is the documentation up-to-date? We seek installation guides, usage instructions, and API references where applicable. [checked at the request for funding support mode]

**Issue Tracking:** Is the project actively tracking issues (e.g., GitHub issues)? How well bugs and feature requests are managed. [checked at the request for funding support mode]

**Roadmap:** Look for a roadmap or project plan that outlines the future direction of the project. We seek to assess if the project plans for continued development aligns with the OpenSSF SIG objectives. [checked at the request for funding support mode]

**Licensing:** The project license terms should be compatible with the Linux Foundationâ€™s so that it allows for free distribution and modification. [checked at both support models]

### Technical Criteria To Be Evaluated

**Dependencies:** Check the project's dependencies and their status.

**Security:** Investigate the project's security practices. Check if there's a responsible disclosure policy, a history of addressing security vulnerabilities promptly, and a good track record in terms of security. (can be [OpenSSF Best Practices badge](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en) and or [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) score).

**Code Quality:** Evaluate the code quality by looking at code reviews, code style consistency, and whether coding standards are followed.

**Compatibility:** What technology stack, operating systems, and hardware does the project support and/or use.

**Case Studies and Use Cases:** Look for real-world use cases or case studies where the project has been successfully implemented.

**Contributor Activity:** Check the activity of project contributors. Are there multiple active contributors, or is the project mostly maintained by one person or organization? 

**Ecosystem:** Consider the broader ecosystem around the project. Are there complementary tools and libraries that enhance its functionality? 
Lifespan: Projects with a longer history of development and usage may be more stable and reliable.
